							<h1 class="major">Comparison of 3 methods of importing map data to models</h1>
							     <p>I am trying to set up a standard process for myself to import environmental and geographical data for architectural projects. </p>		     
							<h2> 1. Blender + MapsModelsImporter + RenderDoc + Chrome </h2>
							     <p>Step 1. Download MapsModelsImporter(v0.4.1) zip file from the following link: https://github.com/eliemichel/MapsModelsImporter/releases/tag/v0.4.1-rc1</p>
							     <p>Step 2. Open Blender ->Edit -> Addons, select downloaded zip file and check the addon box. </p>
								 <p>Step 2. Open Blender ->Edit -> Addons, select downloaded zip file and check the addon box. </p>
								 <p>Step 3. Download RenderDoc 1.13. Originally I downloaded RenderDoc 1.15, but it didn’t work when I later tried to ‘insert into process’. So keep to 1.13 or older versions. </p>
								 <p>Step 4. Go to C disk -> Program Files -> Google -> Chrome -> Application. Right click on Chrome (application file ) and choose ‘create shortcut’ to desktop. Go to desktop, right click the shortcut and choose ‘Properties’. In the Shortcut -> Target window, paste the following: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c "SET RENDERDOC_HOOK_EGL=0 && START "" ^"C:\Program Files    \Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe^" --disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-startup-dialog" </p>
								 <p>Step 5. Now the shortcut has become a command icon. Double click, a window should pop up saying ‘Gpu starting with pid: xxxxx’. Note down the 5-digit number. </p>
								 <p>Step 6. Open RenderDoc. Click File -> Inject Into Process. Here if you use the wrong version of RenderDoc, this selection will not come up. Find the name with the PID number that you have noted down. Click ‘Inject’.  </p>
								 <p>Step 2. Open Blender ->Edit -> Addons, select downloaded zip file and check the addon box. </p>
								 <p>Step 2. Open Blender ->Edit -> Addons, select downloaded zip file and check the addon box. </p>

							    
							<h2> 2. Embedding pdfs in pages </h2>
							     <p>I wanted to embed my portfolios in the webpage. There're several converters online that we can use to change pdf to html, but I am too lazy to download them. Instead I upload the pdf document to my repository and type in the following codes in the desired 'body' session of the portfolio html: </p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_03/image_01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>   
							
							<p>The pdf can be viewed without making the page too bulky, which is good. But the file does not work well on phones. And it always takes a long time to load. Is there a better way?</p>
							
							<h2> 3. Embedding models in pages </h2>
							     <p>There are some models that I want to embed in the pages which allow visitors to interact with. I tried exporting models from Rhino to Blender and to glTF format (which can be embedded in html), but it's not very ideal. So I then tried sketchfab.  </p>
							
							
							
							<!--          <span class="image fit"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture1.png" alt="" /></span>
						        
							     <p>5. Log on to google domain. In ‘DNS’ – ‘custom records’, type in the following </p>
							         <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture2.png" alt="" /></span>
							     <p>6. It will take a long time for the change to take place. Change URL in github-settings-pages again, and this message comes up </p>
							          <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture3.png" alt="" /></span>
							     <p>7. According to the message I have to add another record on my google DNS. I don’t know what the difference is between ALIAS and CNAME, so I’ll just add A record. The IP addresses can be found on Github ‘manage custom domain’ documentation. </p>
							           <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture4.png" alt="" /></span>
							     <p>8. When changing the URL in Github it still doesn’t work. It took about 30 min to propagate. Finally the URL is successfully changed to the desired domain.  </p>
							          <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture5.png" alt="" /></span>
							     <p>9. Then time to design the webpage. The style I wanted to achieve was like https://xiaohegithub.cn/ , which looks geeky and simplistic. What I don’t want to achieve is like https://html5up.net/massively, which looks cool but actually is a mess. </p>
							     <p>10. Before figuring out the detailed process of coding and setting up all the functions I wanted to have, I thought it would be more realistic if I made use of some existing templates first and then modified it.  </p>
							     <p>11. The webpage https://html5up.net/ provides some good template. I downloaded and unzipped one and loaded it onto my repository. </p>
							     <p>12. Go to index.html and change the codes inside. It’s pretty straightforward. </p>
							     <p>13.	When modifying the codes, I started to wonder how Github knows what language I am using. Apparently when editing the website I am using HTML language, but what if I add other files that are written in C++ or JavaScript? How will my repository recognise them and prevent them from collapsing?</p>
