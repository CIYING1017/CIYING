             <section class="content">
                <p>This website is built with html, css & js. The platform is github and editting platform is vscode.  I am a total starter so it did took me some time to understand the languages and the architecture. Here is how I started the exploration. </p><br/>
                <p>1.Previously I've tried wix and wordpress, but neither of them could achieve the flexibility and customisation that I wanted.So I decided to try github. Create a new repository in Github named CIYING. Choose ‘add a README file’. </p><br/>
                <p>2. Click on ‘settings’ and change the ‘sources’ to ‘main’. In ‘Settings ‘-‘Pages’ I can choose a template and publish the website. Here the site name is https://ciying1017.github.io/CIYING/. </p><br/>
                <p>3. Log on to google domain and purchase the desired domain name. Here I bought www.ciyingwang.com. The price of 10 pounds/year is fair. Google domain also provides platforms where you can set up and edit your webpage. </p><br/>
                <p>4. In  I want to change the URL to www.ciyingwang.com but the DNS checking says </p><br/>
                <p><img class="image" src="../images/blog_01/Picture1.png"  />                       
                <p>5. Log on to google domain. In ‘DNS’ – ‘custom records’, type in the following </p><br/>
                <p><img class="image" src="../images/blog_01/Picture2.png"  />
                <p>6. It will take a long time for the change to take place. Change URL in github-settings-pages again, and this message comes up </p><br/>
                <p><img class="image" src="../images/blog_01/Picture3.png"  />
                <p>7. According to the message I have to add another record on my google DNS. I don’t know what the difference is between ALIAS and CNAME, so I’ll just add A record. The IP addresses can be found on Github ‘manage custom domain’ documentation. </p><br/>
                <p><img class="image" src="../images/blog_01/Picture4.png"  />         
                <p>8. When changing the URL in Github it still doesn’t work. It took about 30 min to propagate. Finally the URL is successfully changed to the desired domain.  </p><br/>
                <p><img class="image" src="../images/blog_01/Picture5.png"  />
                <p>9. Then time to design the webpage. The style I wanted to achieve was like https://xiaohegithub.cn/ , which looks geeky and simplistic. The website should leave room for future develpment, so I prefer the form of having multiple html files & external links (so that I can experiment with different styles on different pages). 
                    What I don’t want to achieve is like https://html5up.net/massively, which looks cool but actually is a mess. </p><br/>
                <p>10. Before figuring out the detailed process of coding and setting up all the functions I wanted to have, I thought it would be more realistic to use existing templates first and then modified it.  </p><br/>
                <p>11. The webpage https://html5up.net/ provides some good template. I downloaded and unzipped one and loaded it onto my repository. </p><br/>
                <p>12. Go to index.html and change the codes inside. It’s pretty straightforward. </p><br/>
                <p>13.	Modifying other people's codes is a strenuous process. Sometimes harder than writing my own codes.</p><br/>
                <p>14.	So I then start studying html language (there are tons of tutorials on Youtube and it merely takes 2 hours to master the basics). And then css and javascript. </p><br/>
